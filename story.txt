	Jimmy had just finished creating his java program. He had just learned how to do 
recursive method calling, and was extremenly proud of what he had made. One day, he was 
tinkering around with his program when all of a sudden, like magic, flashes of light burst 
out of his computer and enveloped his entire body, sucking him literally into his own 
program. He felt okay about his situation, realizing that he would just have to wait until 
he arrived at the base case in order to return to the real world. There was just one 
problem: he had made the rookie mistake of forgetting to write a base case for his program.
